812,in fact the survey more specifically points out in the first place there has been no statistical evidence of any increase in economic bads such as consumption of alcohol and tobacco on the contrary in bhil tribal village there was actually a drop in consumption of alcohol since that is where people had liquidity to use for agricultural inputs and therefore one saw an increase in agricultural productivity and own cultivation effect interestingly evidence from africa is also along similar lines as rutger bregman writes in utopia for realists the great thing about money is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that selfappointed experts think they need and as it happens there is one category of product which poor people do not spend their free money on and that is alcohol and tobacco in fact a major study by the world bank demonstrated that in 82 of all researched cases in africa latin america and asia alcohol and tobacco consumption actually declined the congress plans to tackle this problem by making the payment to women in fact former finance minister p chidambaram has said we will insist that every family should open an account in the name of the woman in the family and the money will be transferred to her account the logic here is that free money from the government will make people lazy and this will lead to them dropping out of the labour force let us look at this in the context of nyay an amount of 6000 per month per household has been promised an average indian household has five individuals so this works out to 1200 per month per individual on an average people who feel that individuals will opt out of the workforce because the unit members are earning 1200 per month extra have a very low opinion of the ambitions of indians also if they stop working their situation may continue to be the same as it was earlier and the entire benefit of the extra money will be nullified this concern largely comes from the wrong belief of the rich and the middle class that the poor are poor because they are lazy there is evidence from different parts of the world which does not suggest anything like this as an august 2018 research paper titled universal basic income an effective policy for poverty reduction published by the centre for social justice points out the extent to which ubi disincentives work is dependent on its generosity the alaska permanent fund pays out 2000 annually and analysis has shown that it has little to no effect on the supply of labour by that logic 1200 per individual per month is not high at all in fact the canadian mincome experiment carried out in the 1970s had some very interesting evidence to offer on this front as standing points out in the canadian mincome experiment mothers with newborns stopped working because they wanted to stay at home longer with their babies and teenagers worked less because they were not under much pressure to support their families which resulted in more teenagers graduating this is the kind of withdrawal from the labour force which is good in the long term in fact this is the most genuine concern nyay is expected to cost 36 trillion or around 17 of the forecasted gross domestic product gdp for 201920 as chidambaram has said our calculation shows that it will not cross 2 of the gdp it will be 18 of the gdp at any given point of time this is a lot of money something which can easily derail the scheme as well as government finances in economics there is no free lunch hence the question is where is this money going to come from

days one or the other minister from my government visits the northeastern region of the country and spends time there earlier chief ministers from the northeastern states used to camp in delhi and still not get time to meet ministers i have changed all of this similarly i believe that west bengal can become the epicentre of the development story in the eastern region i want kolkata to enjoy the same status as chennai mumbai bengaluru and hyderabad in the economic sphere

1575,in an age where cameras are coming up everywhere making sense of all the hours of stored footage is where the next big policing breakthrough is likely to come from istock a new technology is beginning to alter policing it may have already helped crack a major case the murder of journalist gauri lankesh while gait analysis has been used as supportive evidence in the uk its use for forensic purposes has been limited elsewhere in september 2018 a special investigation team of the karnataka police identified parashuram waghmare as one of the alleged killers of journalist gauri lankesh who was shot dead in 2017 at her bengaluru residence the lead came through the examination of the walking pattern of the killers as captured in the cctv footage at the time of the murder the directorate of forensic sciences in gujarat which was working with the police on the investigation used a technique called forensic gait analysis to match the walking pattern of the killers with that of the suspects forensic gait analysis is based on the premise that every individual walking pattern is unique it comes in handy to identify a person in cases where the cctv camera has captured the act of the crime but could not capture the face of the perpetrator due to poor lighting the position of the camera or because the face was covered with a mask or cloth the technique was first admitted as evidence by a london court in a murder case in 2000 the perpetrator caught on cctv footage had a bowlegged gait matching one of the suspects which according to the gait expert who offered testimony during the trial was found in only 5 of the country population during gait analysis the walking style of the perpetrator from the cctv footage is examined to generate a pattern called gait signature it is then compared with the gait signature generated from a second footage of suspects which can be from a cctv footage captured before or after the crime or a reenactment of it by law enforcement agencies during the investigation as was done in gauri lankesh murder investigation gait signature is drawn from combination elements such as the posture of the body while walking hand swing the position of head neck and shoulder kneeflexion during stance distance between the steps angle of feet pelvic rotation and weight distribution if done right forensic gait analysis could possibly revolutionize policing in ways similar to the impact that fingerprint analysis had on the field in the early 20th century crime solving is all about matching the remnants of a scene to the person who might have been there while a fingerprint or hair or blood are clear markers of identity the way someone walks could be as unique and integral to identity and in an age where cameras are coming up everywhere making sense of all the hours of stored footage is where the next big policing breakthrough is likely to come from gait analysis can be done manually by carefully examining every frame of the footage and then drawing a conclusion based entirely on observations the other and considerably more reliable approach is the computer vision approach which uses specially designed algorithms to determine a person gait from a video footage and then compares the gait pattern of the perpetrator with that of the suspect this approach uses software tools to measure lengths or angles of the limbs during movements across each frame

2099,call it developmentan election battle cry first popularized way back in the 1990s by gadkari then a member of state legislative council who was so obsessed with flyovers that he would go on to build 50plus of them in mumbai alone when he became the public works minister in the shiv senabjp government in 1995 now he is joined in by maharashtra chief minister devendra fadnavis a local lad who is fast emerging as a new power centre in the post2014 growth story of the bjp and the sangh parivar gadkari once his mentor is today seeing a new challenge in fadnavis new nagpur with all its good and bad bears a gadkarifadnavis signature a marked departure from the waves of transformations of the past the plan according to the nagpur metro rail corporation ltd is to build big towers along the metro routes by giving higher floor space index fsi and in return increasing the resources from the real estate 500 metres on either side of the metro corridor nagpurians doubt if we could ever bring in such businesses though an oxford economics report pitted nagpur to be among the 20 fastest growing cities in the world from 201935 nagpur is an education and a medical hub an economy driven by services small enterprise and trading and regional government offices it began with a handful of few young men in the dusty bylanes of mahal the old town keshav baliram hedgewar formed a small group of swayamsevaks volunteers who would build one of india biggest sociocultural and political organizations the rssthe right wing behemoth that reigns over the country today through its political arm the bjp for decades while the rss shakhas proliferated across the city its political arm the jan sangh and later the bjp remained on the fringes the sangh is not a political organization it is an organization of the entire hindu society and the society is a complex function veteran sangh ideologue mg alias baburao vaidya says the rss volunteers gradually entered into many domains of the society including politics so if your gauge is only politics you will falter in understanding the sangh he says at his modest house it is the soul vaidya who started as a volunteer early on in his life has seen both nagpur and the rss expand over time at 96 he has limited mobility but is still sharp with his memory notwithstanding a stern opposition to their ideology in the early part of the sangh journey it was the ideologues and volunteers like vaidya who steadfastly worked for its propagation today bjp and the rss is the creation of that unflinching foundational work he suggests some people started working on students issues others entered politics some others started working in the field of religion to form the vishva hindu parishad vhp late dattopant thengadi formed a trade union and a farmers organization ekal vidyalaya got started in remote parts there is one organization that works among the lawyers other on culture he says today there are about 36 such entities that work in different spheres but because politics gains prominence the bjp gets the limelight the rss phenomenal expansion and its volunteers steadfast loyalty helps the bjp and its leaders he says nagpur too is not an exception the countrywide rise of the bjp and the sangh parivar and the waning of the congress and its moral compass has altered even nagpur political landscape if the rss was formed here nagpur was also where dr br ambedkar embraced buddhism along with thousands of his scheduled caste supporters at deekshabhoomi in what remains the only democratic example of a bloodless conversion a revolution against caste discrimination that continues to hold promise of an equal society for all those who experienced untouchability it was a thought that revolted against the rss idea of hindutva much of maharashtra scheduled caste intellectual movement got traction from here it still remains the epicentre of the ambedkarite movement on the one hand and rss on the other historically and ontologically the two thoughts remain antithetical to each other nagpur always had staunch left right and centrist movements but never had animosities between them remembers nd khare author and proprietor of one of the region oldest construction firms there was always a bonhomie between various thinkers something that we have lost today nagpur took pride in towering and erudite academicians painters and musicians and of course poets and writers suresh bhat manik godghate alias grace mahesh elkunchwar the list is long politically despite being the rss headquarter and epicentre of ambedkar republican movement nagpur always remained centrist and deeply seculara character that is perceptibly changing in this context 2019 has much at stake for nagpur will nitin jairam

2245,india effort is to make terrorism a global agenda and tell the world that pakistan is in the business of exporting terror to india says pm narendra modi demonetisation might not suit political arithmetic we did it for national interest not for political gains says pm narendra modi on jobs front pm narendra modi says india could not have notched up its fast pace of gdp growth without employment generation new delhi prime minister narendra modi on friday made a strong defence of his government controversial move to demonetise highvalue currencies and its record in job creation demonetisation he said in a wideranging interview with hindustan was launched in national interest not for political gain on the jobs front modi said india could not have notched up its fast pace of gdp growth without employment generation and that 60 million jobs have been created in micro small and medium enterprises msmes alone in the last four years edited excerpts it had been a very satisfactory and extremely good five years my experience in these five years boosted my belief that there is no reason why india should remain in the category of developing countries we have all the capabilities to be a developed country this conviction will continue to be of great help to take the country ahead in the next five years when i came here the situation was much worse than what i have thought it would be it was a terrible situation i was new to this place and i also had to understand issues but as we started taking decisions several worrying things came up my long experience as chief minister helped me to remain confident and i knew that we would find ways and we did find ways it would be difficult to restrict myself to this earlier the government would beat its own drum throughout the year over one or two achievements my case is such that if you take any ministry any state or any development work you can see a new initiative in it there would have hardly been a day in these five years when an important decision was not taken or important work was not done so there are so many achievements and initiatives that to confine it to just three would be an injustice to other departments and my colleagues you made some promises when you assumed charge now that your first term is coming to an end do you think you have not been able to complete the work you set out to if everything gets completed then i think that the world will come to a halt one should look for new energy ambitions and resolutions to move in life the biggest satisfaction i get from my work is that it fuels my ambitions further to do many more new things you launched social schemes such as beti bachao beti padhao jan dhan yojana swachh bharat abhiyan and the mudra scheme you have spoken about social development in a committed manner are you happy with the results the train of india development runs on two tracks one is the social infrastructure another the physical infrastructure keeping in mind the poorest of the poor we must reach that social infrastructure level where everyone has house education health and toilet physical infrastructure should be worldclass look at the time of the independence struggle the country was under occupation for many years every part of the country made sacrifices but what did gandhiji do he changed the independence struggle into people movement you take the broomsticks for independence spin cotton for independence you give adult education for independence you teach for the purpose of independence he added people participation to the freedom movement and changed the latter face i believe that development like freedom struggle should also be a people movement we had previously considered limited programmes as adequate development and this i believe used to be our strategic shortsightedness if we had turned it into people movement the results would have been hundredfold i am sure you know that when there was lesser number of currency notes with highest denomination of 100 in india indira gandhi had come up with a proposal to demonetise according to a book yashwantrao chavan told her do you want to do politics or not do you want to fight elections or not do not fall in this trap so demonetisation might not have suit political arithmetic but for the national interest it had to be done we did it for national interest not for political gains our steps against black money in the last fourandahalf years have resulted in recovery of 130000 crore which has been taxed and awarded penalties properties worth 50000 crores have been seized during this period 6900 crore of benami properties and assets in foreign shores worth 1600 crore have been also seized nearly 338000 she will companies have been identified and deregistered their directors have been disqualified it is also due to demonetisation that tax compliance has almost doubled they the opposition parties did it earlier too this did a lot of campaign in up but they lost very badly they got defeated over all the issues they tried to take to the people it would have been a different thing if they had shown honesty and did some research you tell me there were three lakh she will companies four hundred companies were running in such a small room stretches his hand to show the size hawala trade was going on demonetisation had an impact on the hawala trade and terrorism nia investigations in jammu and kashmir showed that future funding for terror activities were cut off one of the criticisms often voiced is that demonetisation impacted employment what is it that the government is doing on employment generation first of all we have to understand the way employment data is collected in our country for many years we have been doing a sample survey and on its basis a minimum assumption is made let us look at some factsthis may or may not suit some people
